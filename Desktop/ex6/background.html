            Built in 1902, RMS Carpathia was such a vessel. Fitted with a single funnel and four masts, she presented a
sturdy yet graceful appearance. She had a crew of 300 and carried well over 2,000 passengers, mostly in Third
Class, and could carry more than 12,000 tons of dry bulk and refrigerated cargo. Officially classed as a saloon
and Third-Class passenger/cargo steamer, Carpathiaâ€™s twin screws were powered by seven boilers and two 4-
cylinder quadruple expansion engines, producing about 9,000 horsepower. Entering service in 1903, she
provided steady and reliable service from Liverpool to Boston in the summer and from New York to
Mediterranean ports in the winter, transporting mostly Hungarian emigrants. Popular with passengers, her
accommodations were enlarged in 1904. Pricing was economical; Third-Class passage worked out to about a
half penny a mile.
